                <h3>Origins and Location of Chocolate Hills, Bohol</h3>
                <p>
                    The name of Bohol derives from another word "Bo-ho" or Bo-ol. The people who inhabited
                    Bohol were said to be descendants of the Pintados who were living examples of their own folk and culture.
                    Bohol is an island located within the Central Visayas region, which is surrounded by 
                    75 minor islands. It is considered as the tenth largest island of the Philippines.

                    Within the center of Bohol lies the Chocolate Hills which is comprised of 
                    a mesmerizing landscape. It earned its name due to the hills gaining a brown 
                    color during dry seasons and green during wet seasons. These limestone formations are 
                    considered as a very popular tourist attraction within the Philippines.
