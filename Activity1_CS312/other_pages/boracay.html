                <h3>Boracay During the Pandemic</h3>
                <p>In the following weeks, Boracay faced widespread closures, impacting resorts, 
                    shops, schools, bars, and restaurants. The island's residents, aged 21 to 60, 
                    with Quarantine Passes, were allowed to purchase essentials while others stayed 
                    home. Public transport was banned, rendering the island eerily quiet.</p>
                <p>For locals, this lockdown was reminiscent of the 2018 closure, with strict curfews,
                     a liquor ban, closed resorts, and no tourist activity on White Beach, resulting 
                     in significant business and job losses.</p>

                <h3>Boracay After the Pandemic</h3>
                <p>As the pandemic gradually subsided, Boracay embarked on a path to recovery. With 
                    the easing of restrictions and the resumption of international and domestic tourism, 
                    the island began to regain its vibrancy. Tourists from around the world once again 
                    flocked to the pristine shores of White Beach.</p>
                <p>Local businesses, resorts, and restaurants adapted to the new normal, implementing safety 
                    measures to ensure the well-being of both visitors and residents. The island's community 
                    spirit remained resilient, and Boracay emerged as a symbol of hope and resilience.</p>

                <h3>Boracay's Tourism</h3>
                <p>Data from the Malay local government showed that from January to June 17 this year, 
                    Boracay registered 1,040,847 tourists, consisting of 199,098 foreign visitors, 816,426 
                    local tourists, and 25,323 overseas Filipino workers. </p>
                <p>The number surpassed the 850,047 guests who visited the island during the same period last
                    year, as the island relaxed its COVID-19-related travel restrictions and began recovering 
                    from the economic slump caused by the pandemic
