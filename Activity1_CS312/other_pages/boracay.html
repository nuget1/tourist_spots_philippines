                <h3>Boracay During the Pandemic</h3>
                <p>In the following weeks, Boracay faced widespread closures, impacting resorts, 
                    shops, schools, bars, and restaurants. The island's residents, aged 21 to 60, 
                    with Quarantine Passes, were allowed to purchase essentials while others stayed 
                    home. Public transport was banned, rendering the island eerily quiet.</p>
                <p>For locals, this lockdown was reminiscent of the 2018 closure, with strict curfews,
                     a liquor ban, closed resorts, and no tourist activity on White Beach, resulting 
                     in significant business and job losses.</p>

                    the easing of restrictions and the resumption of international and domestic tourism, 
                    the island began to regain its vibrancy. Tourists from around the world once again 
                    flocked to the pristine shores of White Beach.</p>
                <p>Local businesses, resorts, and restaurants adapted to the new normal, implementing safety
